
Several times a year, the PRDN database is refreshed back over the DEVN & TSTN schemas.  This is done so more real
data is found in lower environments.  This however causes a problem for the customer profile in those environments.  After
the refresh, the asset files should still match MB, but the database tables will be the same as production.  So there most
asset rows match nothing like MB data in those environments.

What has to happen is to synchronize up the customer profile again, which is pretty simple.

As the customers login, run the SQL script 01_Reset/ResetAllObjects.sql.  This will truncate the tables and reset
the sequences to 1.

In the Brand-Fixit project run these 2 fixits in the following order.  In both cases, start the count at 0, do it for
1000 cycles and have 5 threads.

FilesystemSync - This is good to run as it will validate the files stored on the file system are accurate.  Not many
inconsistencies should be found.

DatabaseSync - This will add all the Assets once again.  This will take several hours to run because it is performing
a database insert for all assets.

DatabaseSyncValicate - A tool that validates and fixes any meta data issues.  MediaBin web service data is considered the source of truth
and will be compared to IDOL data - AND - Customer Profile data.  If those 2 situations are brought into being in sync then
IDOL and Customer Profile will also be in sync.

DatabaseSyncAddColumns - A tool which will populate new meta data columns in the customer profile.  Values in the customer profile
are overwritten if previously there to assure correct information and to make as fast as possible.
